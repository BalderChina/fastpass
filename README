This is a code release of Fastpass:
  "a datacenter network framework that aims for high utilization with 
   zero queueing. It provides low median and tail latencies for packets,
   high data rates between machines, and flexible network resource 
   allocation policies. The key idea in Fastpass is fine-grained control 
   over packet transmission times and network paths.

   A logically centralized arbiter controls and orchestrates all network 
   transfers."

    - kernel-mod/    Linux kernel module
    - protocol/      FCP (Fastpass Control Protocol) implementation
    - tcp-benchmark/ fine-grained socket throughput measurement for Linux

  bindings/
    - graph-algo/    SWIG bindings for graph-algo, for testing.

  tests/
    - graph-algo/    Some tests for allocators and path selection
    - protocol/      Protocol-related tests

Note that tests were sporadically maintained after modification to src/, so
